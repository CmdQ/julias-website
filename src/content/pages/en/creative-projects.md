## Creative Practice

Whether illustrated essays or interactive installations – my work creates emotional access points to climate futures. Each project is based on research and is created together with the communities for whom it is intended.

### Illustration

Editorial work and visual essays that make data accessible.

### Installation

Immersive experiences that invite policymakers and the public to collectively imagine regenerative futures.

### Story Development

Narrative consulting for film, podcasts, and exhibitions – grounded, empathetic, impactful.
