## Speaking & facilitation

I support museums, schools, and civic groups with climate literacy programs that emphasize agency, emotional resilience, and community imagination. Talks blend visual storytelling with evidence-based frameworks so audiences leave with the tools to lead change.

### Keynotes

- Climate storytelling for systemic change
- Designing hopeful, science-aligned learning spaces
- Supporting learner emotions in the climate classroom

### Programs

- Semester-long curricula co-developed with educators
- Professional development for facilitators and guides
- Community dialogues with actionable next steps
